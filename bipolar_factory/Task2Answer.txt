Video tagging is a complex problem where we have to tagged based on multiple frame. The main challenge is to correctly lable the video. And with endless tag that we can assign to a video it is impossible to tag it manually.

1. Feasibility
It is very much possible to achieve a soultion, there is a very intersting paper on auto video tagging "ViTS: Video Tagging System from Massive Web Multimedia Collections". The tagging algorithm is based on the extraction of keywords from the contextual information associated to a video. 

2.Methodology
We can can use CNN-RNN hybrid architecture descrive in the "Deep Learning YouTube Video Tags" paper it use the video-level visual features generated by the Inception-V3 network and input from Inception-V3 is inputs to a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP). An LSTM is used to learn the label dependencies. The video and label features are combined into a concatenated feature vector for prediction. Basicaly i will follow CNN-RNN hybrid architecture.

3.Challenges
Getting the labelled data will be the main challenge, because manuallty tagging endless data is very tedious task for human to do. And assigning multiple tag to the video is another big challenge.
