1.Data cleaning
- since there were a lot of images that do not contain any text, those data should be removed
- We can filter down the data by the "product_category_tree" because there are certain categories like clothes, furniture, automobile parts that do not contain any text. 
- Each product contain multiple images in an array, decide to use the first image which is usually large and clear images
- Check certain category contain any image or not by opening the image link in the browser
- Add all the category name that contains text in an array and create a final csv file contain only the product name and the image URL

2. OCR text detection
- I have used the offical implementation of CRAFT repo to run the pre trained model of easyOCR
- Image processing did not require because it handed it internally 
- pass in the image to the model and generate a bounding box on the image

3. Building Interface
- Decided to go with flask because it gives more flexibility in designing 
- Show all the product name in a dropdown, as soon as the user select and click on button image will be download and save in the folder
- The save image will pass to the mode for text detection and detected text will be pass to the interface with the detected image
