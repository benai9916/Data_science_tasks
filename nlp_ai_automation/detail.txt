Considering input, I decided to approach this with basic pre-processing to filter out the question and answer from the input text.
I notice a pattern in the question and answer that is it question starts with the question number and end with '?' and the answer starts with the 'Answer' keyword.
Filter question
Text end with '?' is considered as questions.
Filter Answer
split text starts with the answer, and filter out the question start with the question number from the text.

I have use pandas to create a dataframe.
